# üïπÔ∏è PVPN Games
We are proud to release our new project PlayerVPN games. Completely out of html, we have made a completely functioning game website.

# üöÄ How to clone?
You can QUICKLY fork this repository and deploy through ANYTHING!

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues.
There are A FEW issues:
If you play **AmongUS**, just know **if your device can not run WEBGL it will completely mess up the WHOLE website** for you!


If you **WANT** to play 1v1 lol **OR** Smash Karts then **go somewhere else until we find out the loading issues**.


For all you **Cookie Clicker** fans out there, **Cookie Clicker** does not disguise as Schoology with it's title. The favicon does work though so I suggest pinning your **Cookie Clicker** tab while your playing!
